Algorithmic Trading Signal Processor

This project processes historical and current stock market data to generate algorithmic trading signals using Python. Itâ€™s designed to be run as part of an automated trading system. It calculates stock value based on an anchored vwap calculation and looking for certain criteria to be met before a "Buy Signal" or a "Sell Signal" is issued for a stock.

---- What It Does ----

- Loads daily stock data from a MySQL cache
- Evaluates anchored VWAP starting from the last all-time high
- Detects buy and sell signals using custom signal logic
- Tracks market zone state based on SPY behavior
- Stores and updates signals in a MySQL database

All signal functions and market logic are abstracted into separate modules to promote clean, testable design.
